# SQL Summary #
SQL was used to conduct analysis on Pewlett Hackard employees during 1980s and 1990s. I used QuickDBD to sketch out the Entity Relationship Diagrams based on the 6 provided CSV files: 'Departments', 'Dept_Emp', 'Dept_Manager', 'Employees', 'Salaries', and 'Titles'. I used the diagram to create the table schemas in pgAdmin4. The CSV files were imported and analysis performed on the imported values.

Analysis included querying across various tables to list information related to the employees that existed in separate tables through foreign keys, implicit joining, and sub queries. 

See files 'Employee_SQL_Schema.sql' for table schemas,  'Employee_SQL_Queries.sql' for analysis queries, and 'QuickDBD-Employee SQL.png' for entity relationship diagram.
